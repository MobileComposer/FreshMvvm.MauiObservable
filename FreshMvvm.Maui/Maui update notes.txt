SwitchOutRootNavigation is removed but you can just switch the navigation service directly on the MainPage how you would normally within a app.

No need to register navigation services 
FreshIOC.Container.Register<IFreshNavigationService> (this, NavigationServiceName);

FreshIOC has been completely removed.
